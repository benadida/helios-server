%
% Date: 07th May 2008
%
% 1. Abbreviation list added

%             [year] or [year,year]
%             year or year,year
%
%   Reference list ordering: alphabetical by author or whatever passes
%    for author in the absence of one.
%
% Features of the old acmtrans.bst:
% =================================
%
% - all authors appear last name first.
% - all pages are listed xx-xx, (no pp.) and are at the end of the reference
% - publishers are identified as publisher, address
% - conferences papers (inproceedings) may give city of conference,
%   date of conference, and journal that the proceedings appear in.
% - months abbreviated to max four letters (eg. Mar.)
% - volume of a series indicated after the title of the series
% - editors appear after edited title and are identified by a trailing "Eds."
%   not in parentheses.  Editor names are not given in small caps.
%   (unless there is no author line)
% - names terminated with a period even if there is no first name.
% - editions are indicated trailing after the work, not in parentheses.
% - "et al." citations have a protected period to avoid bad spacing (jrh)
% - "address" required when publisher given
% - series (roman) and volume are in a sentence separate from (book-)title
%
%
% Features of chicago.bst:
% =======================
%
% - full names used in citations, but abbreviated citations are available
%   (see above)
% - if an entry has a "month", then the month and year are also printed
%   as part of that bibitem.
% - all conjunctions use "and" instead of "\&"
% - major modification from Chicago Manual of Style (13th ed.) is that
%   only the first author in a reference appears last name first-
%   additional authors appear as J. Q. Public.
% - pages are listed as "pp. xx-xx" in all entry types except
%   article entries.
% - book, inbook, and manual use "location: publisher" (or organization)
%   for address and publisher. All other types list publishers separately.
% - "pp." are used to identify page numbers for all entry types except
%   articles.
% - organization is used as a citation label if neither author nor editor
%   is present (for manuals).
% - "et al." is used for long author and editor lists, or when "others"
%   is used.
%
% Modifications and bug fixes from newapa.bst:
% ===========================================
%
%   - added month, year to bib entries if month is present
%   - fixed bug with In proceedings, added necessary comma after title
%   - all conjunctions changed to "and" from "\&"
%   - fixed bug with author labels in my.full.label: "et al." now is
%        generated when "others" is an author name
%   - major modification from Chicago Manual of Style (13th ed.) is that
%     only the first author in a reference appears last name first-
%     additional authors appear as J. Q. Public.
%   - pages are listed as "pp. xx-xx" in all entry types except
%     article entries. Unnecessary (IMHO) "()" around page numbers
%     were removed, and page numbers now don't end with a period.
%   - created chicago.sty for use with this bibstyle (required).
%   - fixed bugs in FUNCTION {format.vol.num.pages} for missing volume,
%     number, and /or pages. Renamed to format.journal.volume.number.
%   - fixed bug in formatting booktitles: additional period an error if
%     book has a volume.
%   - fixed bug: editors usually given redundant period before next clause
%     (format.editors.dot) removed.
%   - added label support for organizations, if both author and editor
%     are missing (from alpha.bst). If organization is too long, then
%     the key field is used for abbreviated citations.
%   - In proceedings or books of several volumes, no comma was written
%     between the "Volume x" and the page numbers (this was intentional
%     in newapa.bst). Fixed.
%   - Some journals may not have volumes/numbers, only month/year (eg.
%     IEEE Computer). Fixed bug in article style that assumed volume/number
%     was always present.
%
% Original documentation for newapa.sty:
% =====================================
%
% This version was made by modifying the master file made by
% Oren Patashnik (PATASHNIK@SCORE.STANFORD.EDU), and the 'named' BibTeX
% style of Peter F. Patel-Schneider.
%
% Copyright (C) 1985, all rights reserved.
% Copying of this file is authorized only if either
% (1) you make absolutely no changes to your copy, including name, or
% (2) if you do make changes, you name it something other than 'newapa.bst'.
% There are undoubtably bugs in this style.  If you make bug fixes,
% improvements, etc.  please let me know.  My e-mail address is:
%    spencer@cgrg.ohio.state.edu or 71160.3141@compuserve.com
%
% This style was made from 'plain.bst', 'named.bst', and 'apalike.bst',
% with lots of tweaking to make it look like APA style, along with tips
% from Young Ryu and Brian Reiser's modifications of 'apalike.bst'.
%
%
% Start of ACM-Reference-Format-Journals.bst
%
% Note: Many of the new bibentry 'fields' will only work with the 
% 'ACM-Reference-Format-Journals.bst' file. Legacy .bib files (which will, in all probability,
% NOT contain these new fields) will _still_ work with the ACM-Reference-Format-Journals.bst.

  %% are expected to be filled in eventually once more data is
  %% obtained.  The TeX User Group and BibNet bibliography archives
  %% make extensive use of this practice.

  %% empty value.

{
  %% In BibTeX style files, the sequences

  %%     ... "one" "two" output
  %%     ... "one" "two" output.xxx
  %%
  %% ship "one" to the output file, possibly following by punctuation,
  %% leaving the stack with
  %%
  %%     ... "two"
  %%
  %% There is thus a one-string lag in output processing that must be
  %% carefully handled to avoid duplicating a string in the output
  %% file.  Unless otherwise noted, all output.xxx functions leave
  %% just one new string on the stack, and that model should be born
  %% in mind when reading or writing function code.
  %%
  %% BibTeX's asynchronous buffering of output from strings from the
  %% stack is confusing because newline$ bypasses the buffer.  It
  %% would have been so much easier for newline to be a character
  %% rather than a state of the output-in-progress.
  %%
  %% The documentation in btxhak.dvi is WRONG:  it says
  %%
  %%    newline$ Writes onto the bbl file what's accumulated in the
  %%             output buffer. It writes a blank line if and only
  %%             if the output buffer is empty. Since write$ does
  %%             reasonable line breaking, you should use this
  %%             function only when you want a blank line or an
  %%             explicit line break.
  %%
  %%    write$   Pops the top (string) literal and writes it on the
  %%             output buffer (which will result in stuff being
  %%             written onto the bbl file when the buffer fills
  %%             up).
  %%
  %% Examination of the BibTeX source code shows that write$ does
  %% indeed behave as claimed, but newline$ sends a newline character
  %% directly to the output file, leaving the stack unchanged.  The
  %% first line "Writes onto ... buffer." is therefore wrong.
  %%
  %% The original BibTeX style files almost always use "write$ newline$"
  %% in that order, so it makes sense to hide that pair in a private
  %% function like this one, named after a statement in Pascal,
  %% the programming language embedded in the BibTeX Web program.

%%%
%%% For the 2009 release of the official acm-*.bst files, there are to
%%% be NO predefined journal abbreviations in those style files.
%%%
%%% ACM may later develop an official list of mappings of full journal
%%% names of commonly-cited journals to ACM-preferred abbreviations, but
%%% authors should consider that use of any of these commented-out
%%% abbreviations is DEPRECATED unless the BibTeX file itself provides
%%% its own @String{name = "value"} definitions.
%%%
%%% Use of journal (and publisher and address) @String{...}
%%% abbreviations, as opposed to explicit value assignments such as
%%% journal = "J. ACM" and publisher = "IEEE", is preferred in
%%% bibliographic databases, because it makes it easier for journal
%%% production staff to replace those definitions by publisher-preferred
%%% abbreviations when articles are typeset for publication.
%%%
%%% For historical reasons, and because some of these abbreviations are
%%% used in other (non-ACM) bibliography style files, they are preserved
%%% here in comments.  Future releases of the acm*-.bst files are likely
%%% to remove them entirely.
